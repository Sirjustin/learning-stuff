//A function called `setPlayerMoves`, which will take a string representing a player (in the form of `'Player One'` or `'Player Two'`), three move types, and three move values, and set the correct global move variables. The method signature for this function should be as follows: `setPlayerMoves(player, moveOneType, moveOneValue, moveTwoType, moveTwoValue, moveThreeType, moveThreeValue)`.
def setPlayerMoves(){

// A function called `getRoundWinner`, which takes a round number (`1`, `2`, or `3`), compares both player's move types and values for that round, and returns the appropriate winner (`'Player One'`, `'Player Two'`, or `'Tie'`)

// A function called `getGameWinner`, which compares both player's move

//types and values for the whole game and returns the appropriate winner (`'Player One'`, `'Player Two'`, or `'Tie'`

//Bonus: A function called `setComputerMoves`, which chooses three random moves for player two. The move type for each move should be completely random, and the move values should be random but add up to 99.
